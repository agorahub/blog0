His 1971 book <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, which offered a philosophical basis for liberal egalitarianism, also supplied the raw material for an entire “Rawlsian” school of thought. But the reputation of Rawls in the academic world grew just as conservative forces committed to fostering greater inequality were becoming dominant, especially in the Anglo-American countries where Rawlsian ideas were most influential.</p><p>Katrina Forrester is the author of an acclaimed study of John Rawls, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691163086/in-the-shadow-of-justice" target="_blank"><em>In The Shadow Of Justice</em></a> (2019). She spoke to <em>Jacobin </em>about the strengths and shortcomings of Rawlsian theory, the relationship between political philosophy and the politics of power, and the lessons socialists can learn from a critical engagement with liberalism.<br class="smart"><br class="smart"><a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/10/john-rawls-liberalism-political-philosophy-conservative-age?fbclid=IwAR226A3HWR3WtqGGwGDntH-TN83VLbA4ThBE92J9dUjo8keiaPjAmS7MJMc" target="_blank">https://jacobinmag.com/2020/10/john-rawls-liberalism-political-philosophy-conservative-age?fbclid=IwAR226A3HWR3WtqGGwGDntH-TN83VLbA4ThBE92J9dUjo8keiaPjAmS7MJMc</a><br class="smart"></p>
