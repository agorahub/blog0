<p><strong>那些說美國是邪惡帝國主義國家的人, 什樣看李光耀的看法呢?</strong><br class="smart"></p><blockquote>“I, too, feel some sense of regret at this shifting power balance because I see the US as basically a benign power. They have not been aggressive and they are not interested in capturing new territories. They fought in Vietnam not because they want to capture Vietnam. They fought in Korea not because they want to capture North and South Korea. They were fighting wars for a cause, and the cause then was anti-communist. They wanted to prevent the world from becoming more communist. If they had not intervened and held out for so long in Vietnam, the will to resist communism in the other Southeast Asian countries would have dissipated, and Southeast Asia might have fallen like dominoes in the face of a red tide. Nixon bought time for South Vietnam to build up and fight on its own. The South Vietnamese did not succeed, but the extra time bought enabled Southeast Asia to get its act together and to lay the foundations for the growth of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.</blockquote><blockquote>Singapore is quite comfortable with the Americans being present. We do not know how brash or assertive China will become. When I said in 2009 that we must balance China, they translated the word in Chinese into “conscribe”, and there was a big uproar among their netizens, who asked how dare I say that when I am a Chinese. They are hypersensitive. And even after I pointed out to them that I never said “conscribe”, they were not placated. It is a young, raw power coming to the fore.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Vietnam, for instance, is one of the unhappiest nations when it comes to the expansion of Chinese power. Deng Xiaoping attacked North Vietnam in 1979 in retaliation for them making a move on Cambodia. He destroyed a few towns and villages and withdrew, just to send a stern reminder to the Vietnamese: “I can go right into Hanoi and take you over.” It is not a lesson the Vietnamese will forget. One strategy probably already being discussed within the Vietnamese government is how they can begin cultivating long-term security ties with the Americans”</blockquote><p>取自 lee kuan yew - one man's view of the world</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
